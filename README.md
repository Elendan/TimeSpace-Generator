# OpenNos Timespace Generator

- Thanks to OpenNos developers, we re-used their packetfactory in order to have a clean packet parsing (github of the emulator's project : https://github.com/OpenNos/OpenNos)
- Thanks to Kraken, who already made a sort of generator, the algorithms are mostly from him (github: https://github.com/Kraken01)
- This project has been done as a proof or concept, any issue or **constructive** criticism will be taken into account
- You can also pull request if you've fixed a but or implemented something useful, we'll review it and eventually merge it
